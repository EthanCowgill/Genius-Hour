<h1>Cheats</h1>
<p>you can always cheat in a pokemon game let me tell you some cheats that take place in pokemon sun and moon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to supermart(with supersale)go to lady in red speak to her buy 11 pokeballs(normal)and you will get a premier ball sell those 11 pokeballs and you will get all your money back and you got a free premier ball</li>

<li>Go to melemele island from then go to the beach in hau'oli city go on lapras/shrpedo go to small piece of land on the right once you get on get on stoutland and you will sniff out a rare candy pick it up and come back to that spot a couple days later and try it again sometimes you will get a free rare candy</li>
<li>One way to get a rare candy a day is go to battle tree beat single battle unlock super single then battle super singles until you beat battle 20 then when you come the next day and talk to the woman that you talk to when you want to challenge the battle tree she will give you a rare candy over a period of time this could prove very helpful when you need to level up high level pokemon</li>

<h1>Shiny pokemon</h1>
<p>Those tips were the way to go to get items with minimun effort now I will tell you how to some ways to get shiny pokemon.Shiny pokemon are very rare variants of pokemon that are different colors from its original form and it is amazing to call out a shiny when doing an online battle,people love doing that(especially me)!</p>

<ul>
<h1>SOS method</h1>
<li>First get an adreniline orb a pokemon with the ability pressure and the move false swipe get in a battle with the pokemon you want shiny.Now you use your adreniline orb and next turn use false swipe.If you get it to 1 hp it will probably call for a pokemonfrom there you kill the pokemon called in and then it will call for another(with most pokemon)from there you will have to keep in mind of its moves and if they run out it would struggle and kill itself.Once it calls for a pokemon you are starting a chain after a while your chain gets high and you will get a shiny(This method will go faster if you have the shiny charm). 
<h1>Horde chaining</h1>
<li>Horde chaining can only work in pokemon X and Y and omega ruby and alpha saphire but you need a pokemon with sweet scent use it in grass then most the time but if not use it in a different piece of grass or route but when you do get 5 pokemon you have a better chance of getting a shiny.</li>
<h1>Pokerus training</h1>
<p>As some of you know there is this thing called pokerus.Pokerus helps the growth of a pokemon meaning it doesn't take as much experience points to level up.Anyway if you have one pokemon with pokerus put it in your party with pokemon that aren't all level 100 then the pokerus will spread and you pokemon will level up quicker and it helps for hard level pokemon that are nearing level 100.</p>
